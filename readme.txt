Even or Odd Number Checker Program:
This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program checks whether a user-inputted number 
is even, odd, or neutral (0).

Program Overview:
- Prompts the user to input a number
- Checks the number using conditional statements
- Outputs whether the number is even, odd, or neutral (0)

Features:
- User input for a number
- Conditional statements to check the number's parity
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:
1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./even_odd_checker
    - On Windows: even_odd_checker.exe
4. Enter a number when prompted

Learning Objectives:
- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using conditional statements (if, else if, else) in C++
- Working with integer variables and modulus operator
